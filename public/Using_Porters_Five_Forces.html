<h1 style="text-align: center">Porter's Five Forces in Practice</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    This model is widely used in order to evaluate a company's position within its industry and its competitiveness.
    Although applicable to any industry, it is best used when evaluating factors specific to the company. If the
    company spans multiple industries, then it should evaluate the Five Forces separately for each industry. There are
    three basic steps to perform an industry analysis:
</p><br/>

<h2>Step 1: Gather Information on Each Force</h2><br/>

<h2>Step 2: Analyze Results & Display in Diagram</h2>

<h2>Step 3: Formulate Strategy Based on Conclusions</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    Using the information obtained from the first two steps, the company can then translate its advantages or
    disadvantages into specific strategies to implement in order to improve its competitive position within its
    industry. For example, in the above analysis, the example industry has a high threat of new entrants. In order to
    mitigate this threat, the company could create strategies to increase customer loyalty and to differentiate itself
    by developing specialties in order to improve its competitive advantage.
