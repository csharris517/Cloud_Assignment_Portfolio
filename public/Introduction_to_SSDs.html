    <li>What is the usual bottleneck for a computer?</li>
    <p>The bottleneck (slowest component) is usually the hard drive.</p>
    <li>Do solid state drives wear out in normal usage? Is this relevant?</li>
    <p>Yes, SSDs do wear out over time with normal usage. This is not relevant to normal users or enterprise
        environments, as most other components of a device will wear out faster. It is relevant in a data center
        environment because data is accessed more frequently.</p>
    <li>In terms of MTBF how long to SSDs last compared to platter based HDs?</li>
    <p>The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is generally twice as long with SSDs as with platter based HDs.</p>
