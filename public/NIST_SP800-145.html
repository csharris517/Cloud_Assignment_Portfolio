    <li>From NIST's perspective, what are Cloud Computing's five essential attributes?</li>
    <p>According to NIST, the five essential attributes of Cloud Computing are:</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- On-Demand Self-Service: customer is in control of resources without needing to interact with service
        provider</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Broad Network Access: available over network through client platforms</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Resource Pooling: resources pooled to serve multiple consumers</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Rapid Elasticity: scalability (vertical and horizontal) should be able to scale rapidly</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Measured Service: leverage a metering capability to automatically control resource use</p>
    <li>What are the three Cloud Computing service models that NIST cites?</li>
    <p>NIST lists the following Cloud Computing service models:</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Software as a Service (SaaS): ability to use provider's applications running on cloud infrastructure</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Platform as a Service (PaaS): consumer deploys and controls application, but does not manage
        infrastructure</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): customer has control over operating systems, storage, deployed
        applications.</p>
    <li>What are the four Cloud Computing deployment models that NIST cites?</li>
    <p>The four Cloud Computing deployment models cited by NIST are:</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Private Cloud: on-premise or off-premise, provisioned for use by a single organization</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Community Cloud: provisioned for use by a specific community of consumers from organizations
        that have shared concerns</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Public Cloud: open for use by the general public. Exists on premises of cloud provider.</p>
    <p style="padding-left:20px">- Hybrid Cloud: composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that remain unique entities
        but are bound together by technology that enables data and application portability</p>
