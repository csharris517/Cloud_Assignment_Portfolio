<p>Virtualization is essentially the ability to create a computer within a computer. This "computer" acts as
    a separate system with a separate Operating System, processor, and memory, only in a virtual
    machine environment. The hypervisor is the software or firmware that creates and manages virtual
    machines (guests) running on the physical machine (host). Virtualization is more cost and resource
    effective because it allows you to run many applications on one server, as opposed to running one
    application per server as shown in Figure A above.</p>
