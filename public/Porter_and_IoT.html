    The <strong>Internet of Things</strong> refers to the increasingly large number of things that are connected to a
    network and the communication that takes place between these things. As these items become more and more prevalent,
    companies and products that have had little competition in the past are now faced with new challenges.

    Over the past few years, many new "smart" products have hit the market that did not exist previously. To exemplify
    the concept of Porter's Five Forces and the effects of the Internet of Things on industry, we could look at a very
    popular item: the smartwatch. For decades, the watch industry faced very few major entrants. However, as companies
    such as Samsung and Apple entered their market, the old watch companies faced the threats of new entrants and
    substitution. To design for the Internet of Things using Porter's Five Forces in this example, companies like
    Citizen and Fossil have begun adding IoT technologies to their products to maintain their industry position.
