    As you can see from the illustration above, <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> affects all activities within an
    organization, even creating new support and primary activities. Below is how each activity in Porter's Value Chain
    Model can be impacted by the proliferation of Cloud Computing in business.
</p><br/>

<h2>Primary Activities</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Inbound Logistics</strong>, <strong>Operations</strong>, and <strong>Outbound Logistics</strong> are all
    part of an organization's supply chain. Supply chain management has been greatly affected by the introduction of
    SCM Information Systems that are integrated with the cloud. Using cloud and internet of things technologies, an
    organization has an automated way of tracking and managing goods as they flow through the value chain. For example,
    a company may have an Inbound Logistics system in place that automatically places an order using cloud services when
    raw goods inventory is low. This automation saves time and resources, thus adding more value to the finished goods
    or services.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Marketing and Sales</strong> and <strong>Service</strong> are not as obviously impacted by Cloud Computing.
    However, the effects can be of great benefit to the organization. Consider, for instance, cell phone applications.
    A large portion of many apps' revenue is from advertisements. This mobile/Cloud Computing technology has introduced
    a new method for Marketing and Sales to reach new potential customers in an automated and direct way.
</p><br/>

<h2>Support Activities</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Procurement</strong> is affected by the introduction of Cloud Computing in that it is much easier for
    organizations to make purchases from other organizations using SaaS (Software as a Service) applications such as
    some e-commerce websites. <strong>Technology Development</strong> is the most impacted support activity. Not only do
    organizations now consider designing their goods and services with IoT technologies, but they should also be
    designing their internal Information Systems to operate in - or in connection with - the Cloud.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Human Resource Management</strong> and <strong>Infrastructure</strong> are less obviously impacted but have
    made vast improvements with SaaS Cloud Computing. For example, organizations can purchase entire software suites
    that handle internal communications including ticket management systems, Human Resource Portals, and communications
    software such as Skype for Business.
