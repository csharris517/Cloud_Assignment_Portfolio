<h2>About Porter's Forces</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    Michael E. Porter was a professor at Harvard Business School. He first developed and published the five forces in
    1979 in his article "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy" for the Harvard Business review. The purpose of this was
    to provide a "new way to use effective strategy to identify, analyze and manage external factors in an
    organization's environment" (<a href="https://www.cleverism.com/porters-five-forces-model-strategy-framework/" ,
                                    target="_blank">Cleverism</a>).

    This model can be applied to any industry. However, it is applied differently for each industry, as each industry
    is different. The Five Forces are broken up into two types: Horizontal and Vertical forces. The Five Forces Porter
    identified are:

<h2>Competitive Rivalry</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Competitive Rivalry</strong> is a <i>horizontal force</i> that describes the degree of rivalry that exists
    between the companies currently in the market. One example of a market in which competitive rivalry is high is
    grocery stores. Because there are many chains that sell similar or identical products, a company in the grocery
    store market has little power in the industry.
</p><br/>
<h2>Threat of New Entrants</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The <strong>Threat of New Entrants</strong> is another <i>horizontal force</i>. As its name describes, it refers to
    how easy or difficult it is for new companies to enter the market. This is determined by the industry's <i>barriers
    to entry</i>, e.g. patents, high initial capital investment, customer loyalty to existing companies, etc. The Threat
    of New Entrants can change at any time, however, if changes in technology or processes in place occur that remove
    these barriers.
</p><br/>
<h2>Threat of Substitutes</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The <strong>Threat of Substitutes</strong> is the last <i>horizontal force</i>. Substitutes are products in another
    industry that could be used to fulfill the same need. One example of this would be filtered bottles for water (e.g.
    Brita Bottle). While these reusable bottles are not in the same category as bottled filtered water (e.g. Dasani),
    they can satisfy the same need and thus impact sales for companies in the bottled water industry.
</p><br/>
<h2>Bargaining Power of Buyers</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The <strong>Bargaining Power of Buyers</strong> is a <i>vertical force</i> that refers to the ability of buyers to
    affect prices in the industry. This occurs mostly in industries where companies buy in bulk or can switch to
    another supplier without a great impact on cost. The supplier becomes dependent on the buyer and has low power in
    this situation with regards to sales terms.
</p><br/>
<h2>Bargaining Power of Suppliers</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The <strong>Bargaining Power of Suppliers</strong> is the last of Porter's forces, and it is a <i>vertical force</i>.
    Suppliers are those who provide companies with the materials to produce their goods or services. In a situation
    where suppliers have high bargaining power, they are more able to dictate the terms of sales with the buyers. High
    Bargaining Power of Suppliers is a result of a high buyer-to-seller ratio, causing it to be more expensive to switch
    suppliers.
