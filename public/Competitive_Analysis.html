<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The Industrial Internet of Things is a new, far-reaching, and loosely defined industry. Thus, its competitive
    analysis is somewhat abstract. While the Internet of Things has been around somewhat longer, the building of systems
    to integrate these devices was inevitable and will continue to grow. These devices will continue to generate data
    for the expansion and improvement of these systems.

<h2>Competitive Analysis Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Competitive Rivalry</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    Since this industry is relatively new, there are not many competitors currently, and the industry growth rate is
    very high. The product differentiation will be probably very low until the systems are well established enough to
    become specialized. The buyer's switching cost could be high depending on the depth of integration of the system.
    Competitors will likely be diverse as they are added to the industry in order to try and give themselves a
    competitive edge in the industry.
</p>
<h3>Threat of New Entrants</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The barriers to entry for this industry are very high. To enter requires a great deal of capital investment and
    research and development. Since the distribution channels are mostly interior for building these systems, that will
    most likely not be a major barrier to entry. The industry is growing, so new entrants are likely in some form, but
    not in any way that would threaten the incumbents' current market share.
</p>
<h3>Threat of Substitutes</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    Given the nature of this industry's service, the only threat of substitute that really exists is customers
    developing these integration systems in-house.
</p>
<h3>Bargaining Power of Buyers</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    The number of buyers relative to sellers is very high, as there are few firms that currently design these systems.
    Product differentiation is low and switching costs are somewhat immaterial given the low number of competitors.
    This industry will increase buyers' profit margins, but the likelihood of using multiple sources or backward
    integration is very low. This product should be very important to the buyer, as indicated by the article referenced
    on the previous page.
</p>
<h3>Bargaining Power of Suppliers</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    In this industry, the power lies mostly with suppliers because there are relatively few now. Since the industry is
    of an information technology nature with little physical input needs, the threat of bargaining power from suppliers
    is mostly low. However, as these systems become more standardized, more suppliers of individual components will
    most likely become much more prevalent.
