<h2>Those We Have</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    In the Internet of Things realm, the "smart fridge" does currently exist to a certain extent. As they are now,
    these smart refrigerators have interactive touch-screen displays with networking capabilities that can provide
    owners with useful information and chosen news feeds, weather, etc. While these are a major advance in refrigerator
    technology, their utility is very low because most of these functions can be achieved by using other networked
    devices.

<h2>Those We're Working Towards</h2>

    Imagine, if you will, that you are at the grocery store and forget whether or not you have coffee creamer in the
    fridge at home, and if it has expired or will expire soon. Now, imagine being able to pull out your phone, open an
    app that is connected to your fridge at home, and being able to see information about everything in your fridge.
    This would be achieved by an RFID reader that is in your fridge that stores information from RFID chips on every
    item that you put into and take out of your fridge.

    has already implemented a similar technology to track blood supplies.  However, you most likely won't be able to
    utilize this technology for years still to come, as I will explain in the next pages.
