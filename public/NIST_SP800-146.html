    <li>What are the two parts of a consumer's terms of service for cloud computing?</li>
    <p>The two parts of a consumer's terms of service for a cloud are a service agreement and a Service Level
        Agreement</p>
    <li>What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?</li>
    <p>A document stating what technical performance a provider promises to provide a consumer, including
        remedies for failing to do so.</p>
    <li>What is a Service Agreement?</li>
    <p>A document that specifies the rules of the legal contract between consumer and provider.</p>
    <li>What are the three main parts of a cloud provider's service agreement?</li>
    <p>- Promises made to consumers</p>
    <p>- Collection of promises explicitly not made to consumers (limitations)</p>
    <p>- Set of obligations that consumers must accept</p>
    <li>How do customers access a cloud?</li>
    <p>Customers access their cloud over a network.</p>
    <li>What is the general architectural model employed in cloud computing?</li>
    <p> Generally speaking, cloud computing employs the client-server architectural model, where clients are
        the cloud consumers.</p>
    <li>In a cloud context, what is a security perimeter?</li>
    <p>The security perimeter is a barrier to access. It employs a boundary controller that enforces a policy
        over access to the resources inside the perimeter.</p>
    <li>Describe the risks associated with using a multi-tenancy on-site-private cloud.</li>
    <p>Client workloads could be exposed to one another because of a flaw in the implementation of access
        policies or in the provider's management and operational policies/procedures, leading to a
        compromise in security.</p>
    <li>In a public cloud, what are some of the systems that network dependency is associated with?</li>
    <p>In a public cloud scenario, the network is dependent upon the Internet, thus also depends upon DNS
        servers, router infrastructure, inter-router links, and connection via an ISP.</p>
