<h2>What is Porter's Value Chain Model?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto">
    Michael Porter, as mentioned in the assignment <a href="Porter_Competitive_Model.html" , target="_blank">Porter's
    Competitive Model</a>, also developed what is referred to as the Value Chain Model or Generic Value Chain. The aim
    of this model is to show "how goods and services move through an organization and value is added to them" (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wL6x1BSlw8" , target="_blank">Dennis Adams</a>). The model breaks an
    organization's activities into <i>Support Activities</i> and <i>Primary Activities</i>. <strong>Support
    Activities</strong> are also known as "overhead activities". These are the activities that are not directly involved
    in primary operations but are essential to the organization's functions. <strong>Primary Activities</strong> are the
    primary value adding activities for a company.
</p><br/>

<h2>Primary Activities</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Inbound Logistics</strong> is considered a <i>primary activity</i> because it involves the obtaining of raw
    materials in order to produce the organization's goods or services.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Operations</strong> is the second <i>primary activity</i>. It involves the organization performing
    operations on the raw materials in order to add value to them by transforming them into a finished good or service.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Outbound Logistics</strong> is the <i>primary activity</i> which involves getting the finished goods or
    services into inventory and eventually distributed to be sold to stores and/or customers.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Marketing and Sales</strong> is the process of marketing a good to the public or organizations in order to
    increase its sales. This is a <i>primary activity</i> because it increases the good's exposure and thus further adds
    value.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Service</strong> is the final value-adding <i>primary activity</i> and pertains to services performed after
    the good or service has already been sold or consumed.
</p><br/>

<h2>Support Activities</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Infrastructure</strong> can refer to legal infrastructure, accounting infrastructure, or anything that needs
    to be in place for the organization to perform its normal operations. This <i>support activity</i> is very important
    because not only does it support the primary activities, but it also helps maintain the other support activities.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Human Resource Management</strong> is the function of a business that insures that there are enough and the
    correct people working for the organization. This <i>support activity</i> affects all primary activities because
    people must be hired and managed for each activity along the value chain.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Technology Development</strong>, in this case, refers both to the Research and Development function of
    developing new goods and services and the development of IT processes. This is a <i>support activity</i> because
    assist in the business's primary activities.
</p><br/>
<p style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: auto">
    <strong>Procurement</strong> refers to the purchasing of goods along the value
    chain. While these goods may be necessary in the finished goods or services, they do not directly add value. Thus,
    Procurement is a <i>support activity</i>.
