<p>Scalability - the ability to scale up or down at a moment's notice - is one of the cloud's greatest benefits.
    Vertical Scaling, as shown above, is increasing or decreasing the size of cloud servers with no change to code and
    is very easy to implement. It is limited in the fact that you can only add CPU or RAM but can only get as big as the
    size of the server. Horizontal scaling, as shown below, is the addition of more cloud servers ("wider") to handle
    increased traffic by decreasing the load on each server. However, it is more difficult and takes more time to
    implement because it requires code adjustment and advanced planning.</p>
