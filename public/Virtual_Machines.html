<h2 style="text-align: left">Using a Virtual Machine</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Compare and contrast the terms host and guest operating system.</li>
    <p>Host and Guest Operating Systems are both fully-functional and usable Operating Systems located on the same machine.
    However, the Host Operating System is the OS native to the machine, and Guest Operating Systems are the instances of
    Operating Systems installed and operating simultaneously on the physical machine.</p>
    <li>Name two different types of virtual machine software suitable for Windows based computers.</li>
    <p>Professor Messer cites Microsoft Virtual PC (available from
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702", target="_blank">Microsoft</a>) and
        VirtualBox (available from <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org", target="_blank">Oracle</a>), both of which are free,
        as being suitable for Windows based computers.</p>
    <li>When you plan to run a VM on a Windows Laptop, what two resources are considered especially critical?</li>
    <p>In order to run Virtual Machines, you need to have plenty of RAM and disk space.  This is because the Guest Operating
    Systems and the Host Operating System are sharing the resources of the physical machine.  Memory and disk space is required
    for each OS.</p>
    <li>Why might you want to turn your installation disks into ISO files?</li>
    <p>You can take everything off of multiple installation disks and encapsulate them into one disk image file.  This makes
    the process of accessing and installing what is on those disks much faster and easier.</p>
    <li>In a virtual machine context, what is a snapshot?</li>
    <p>A snapshot can be viewed as a "recovery point" for an Operating System, with its configuration and current state saved.
    This means that you can take a snapshot of an OS, make changes to it, and even delete it, then go back
    to the the configuration the OS was in at the time the snapshot was taken.</p>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Virtual Desktops and Servers</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What is a Hypervisor?</li>
    <p>A Hypervisor is a piece of software, also known as a "virtual machine manager", that allows you to manage the Virtual
    Machines and their relationships to the hardware in the physical machine.  It also maintains separation between the virtual
    systems.</p>
    <li>What is a Type 1, Bare Metal Hypervisor?</li>
    <p>With a Type 1 Hypervisor, you start with a raw (blank) server and install the Hypervisor directly onto the machine.
    You then install the Operating System instances onto the hypervisor from another networked computer with Management
    Software using a Management Console.</p>
    <li>What is a Type 2 Hypervisor?</li>
    <p>Type 2 (or "hosted") hypervisors are installed onto an Operating System itself on a physical computer.  You can then
    install Operating System instances into that hypervisor.</p>
    <li>Name three advantages of virtualization.</li>
    <p>By consolidating multiple servers onto one physical device, you can save a lot of room in the data center, have much
    more flexibility around what you can do with the hardware, and save on the cost of running one virtualization server vs.
    many physical servers.</p>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Virtual Switches</h2>
<ol>
    <li>What impact does changing from a physical environment to a virtual environment have on the
        network components?</li>
    <p>When you migrate from a physical environment to a virtual environment, you are also virtualizing the networking components,
    removing them from the server platform.</p>
    <li>Describe a challenge associated with virtualizing your network components.</li>
    <p>One of the challenges is the integration with the outside world.  Multiple servers may previously have each had its own
    ethernet connection, but you may have to build in connection redundancy in order for all of the virtual servers to share the
    network resources without compromising speed.</p>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Network as a Service</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Explain what the term Network as a Service (NaaS) means.</li>
    <p>Network as a Service refers to network virtualization inside the cloud, completely offsite.  You can then move your
    platforms, applications, and Network onto the cloud, completely virtualizing those operations.</p>
    <li>Name four advantages of Network as a Service (NaaS).</li>
    <p>- Allows you to have an application used by thousands of people and have the third party NaaS provider handle network traffic.</p>
    <p>- You can migrate your entire network around the world to accommodate for different geographic peak times.</p>
    <p>- Your network connection can expand and contract, allowing you to add or remove bandwidth as needed.  This is useful when
    your networked application has varying time-based peak times.</p>
    <p>- You can work on your application from anywhere.  If you decide to move your entire office, the network stays where it is.</p>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left">Onsite vs. Offsite Virtualization</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Name three advantages of onsite virtualization</li>
    <p>- Complete control</p>
    <p>- Flexibility to change and shift as needed</p>
    <p>- Secure as you need</p>
    <li>Name three disadvantages of onsite virtualization.</li>
    <p>- Costly</p>
    <p>- Requires significant networking infrastructure</p>
    <p>- Not easy to upgrade</p>
    <li>What does the term "Virtualize in the cloud" mean?</li>
    <p>"Virtualize in the cloud" refers to offsite virtualization, where all of your applications, servers, and Operating
        Systems are maintained elsewhere.</p>
    <li>Name four advantages of offsite virtualization.</li>
    <p>- No infrastructure cost</p>
    <p>- Management/maintenance is handled by others</p>
    <p>- Geographical flexibility</p>
    <p>- Seemingly unlimited upgrade options</p>
    <li>Name two disadvantages of offsite virtualization</li>
    <p>- Data is also in the cloud (security concern)</p>
    <p>- Contractual limitations (long-term contracts)</p>
